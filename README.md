# Linear-Regression-Model-Performance-Evaluation
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict a target variable based on multiple features in a dataset. The goal is to evaluate the model’s accuracy using key metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).
